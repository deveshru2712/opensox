![Taking imperfect action](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G5aMbWTbcAEr9vp?format=jpg&name=medium)

I use the term **"ugly execution"** to define a state when you don't care about the perfectness in anything and just act.

When you understand that **life rewards action, not perfection.**

## What Ugly Execution Looks Like

When your camera sucks, but still you hit that red button, record a scrappy and embarrassing video, and click on "post" and actually post it on YouTube.

When your website's UI sucks, authentication fails, gets "build errors" randomly, and lags like government websites, but you still publish it and let people use it.

When your resume looks like a blank slate, but you still apply for the job you wanted.

## The Uncomfortable Truth

Your inner self is uncomfortable doing that, but you know that this **"chase of perfection" has the potential to kill your dreams.**

You know that if you don't act now, your net output in the future will be zero.

You know, acting, getting stuck, failing, making a stupid mistake, getting embarrassed, is **way better** than creating a mental prison for yourself by useless thinking, worrying, and planning.

## Stop Chasing Aesthetics

Don't wait for the perfect:

- Time
- Camera
- Mic
- Laptop
- Place
- Circumstances
- Website
- People

You get the point.

## The Only Rule That Matters

**JUST START WITH WHATEVER YOU HAVE**

**LET THE EXECUTION BE UGLY**

**JUST BE GOOD AT UGLY EXECUTION**

**LIFE WILL REWARD YOU EXPONENTIALLY.**
