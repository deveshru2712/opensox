![Journey from farm to founder](https://imgs.search.brave.com/0NvT2qcazrFJeTKxSWwaaSCfq2Ak2DCGgdHPup131xQ/rs:fit:860:0:0:0/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93YWxs/cGFwZXJzLmNvbS9p/bWFnZXMvZmVhdHVy/ZWQvaGFyZC13b3Jr/LXBpY3R1cmVzLTMw/YjY2amNnc203aGw2/djIuanBn)

## The Beginning: Breaking Free

I was born and raised on a farm. Despite nailing my studies, I got rejected by the air force. My parents, like many Indian parents, pushed hard for a government job—the "safe" option. At 18, I made a choice that would change everything: I left home.

My first job? A receptionist at a hotel. Not glamorous. Not prestigious. But it was _mine_.

## The Pivot: A Computer and a Dream

I bought a computer with my savings. Late nights after hotel shifts, I taught myself programming. No college degree. No connections. No safety net. Just documentation, tutorials, and an obsessive drive to learn.

Eventually, I quit the hotel job and started from absolute scratch in tech.

## The Grind: Open Source and GSoC

I dove into open source. My first Google Summer of Code application? **Rejected.**

But I didn't stop. I worked harder, contributed more, made genuine friends in the community. The second time around, I didn't just get in—I excelled. Internships followed. Job offers came. I even became a **GSoC mentor** myself.

While still learning and growing, I started earning lakhs. I paid my brother's college fees. I covered my father's medical treatment. The farm boy who left home at 18 was now supporting his family.

## The Leap: Building Something Real

Despite the stable job and good income, I couldn't shake the itch to build something of my own. I started a side project. It grew to **10,000 users**. Then came **2 investment offers**.

The numbers spoke for themselves: my side project revenue crossed my salary. I left the job.

Now I'm scaling [opensox.ai](http://opensox.ai), and the journey continues.

## The Lesson: You Can Just Do Things

There's no secret formula. No hidden shortcut. No "right" background.

What worked for me:

- **Self-belief over credentials** – No college degree couldn't stop me from learning to code
- **Community over isolation** – Open source connected me with people who became mentors and friends
- **Action over permission** – I didn't wait for someone to give me a chance; I created my own
- **Persistence over perfection** – Failed GSoC? Applied again. Got rejected? Kept building.

If you're reading this from a small town, from a non-tech background, from a place where startup dreams seem impossible—know this: **You can just do things.**

You don't need permission. You don't need a fancy degree. You need a computer, internet, and the refusal to quit.
